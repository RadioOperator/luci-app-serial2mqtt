# luci-app-serial2mqtt
OpenWRT LuCI config template for [serial2mqtt](https://github.com/vortex314/serial2mqtt) and [serial2mqtt-openwrt](https://github.com/halfbakery/serial2mqtt-openwrt).

This project is not completed, it generates the openwrt config file only (serial2mqtt_cfg), not linked to the serial2mqtt yet.

You could contribute on it, thanks.

There are two ways to continue:
1. modify serial2mqtt to capture configs from luci config file.
2. convert luci config file to serial2mqtt.json.
